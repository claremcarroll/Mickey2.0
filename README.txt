Hi there! My name is Clare Carroll and this is my submission for the Delphix Scholarship.

TO RUN:

Unfortunately, as of Processing 2.1 Oracle's Java doesn't support 32-bit, so 32-bit applications on OS X are not possible. Therefore you will have to install Processing to run this program. Also, this needs to be run on a computer with a webcam (tested only on Mac).

Step 1: Install Processing (https://processing.org/download/). You can enter 0 into the custom amount for donations.

Step 2: Drag all of the libraries included in the Mickey2016/libraries folder into your processing/libraries folder. If processing still cannot find these libraries, you can go to Sketch -> Import Library -> Add Library and search for sdrop, video processing foundation, minim mills, and opencv to install them separately. 

I’m really sorry to make you do all of this work! My next implementation will be in Javascript and this will be much more smooth.

Step 3: Double click on any .pde file in the Mickey2016 folder to launch the project in the editor. 

Step 4: Click play!

Photos will save to a folder called YourPhotoboothPhotos2016 in the Mickey2016 folder. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have issues!
