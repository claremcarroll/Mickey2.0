Hi there! My name is Clare Carroll and this is my submission for the Delphix Scholarship.

TO RUN:

Unfortunately, as of Processing 2.1 Oracle's Java doesn't support 32-bit, so 32-bit applications on OS X are not possible. Therefore you will have to install Processing to run this program. Also, this needs to be run on a computer with a webcam (tested only on Mac).

Step 1: Install Processing (https://processing.org/download/). You can enter 0 into the custom amount for donations.

Step 2: Drag all of the libraries included in the libraries folder into your processing/libraries folder

Step 3: Double click on any .pde file in the sketch folder to launch the editor. 

Step 4: Click play!

Photos will save to a folder called YourPhotoboothPhotos2016 in the Mickey2016 folder.
